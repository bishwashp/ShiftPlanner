How to Run ShiftPlanner
=========================

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the ShiftPlanner application on a new machine.

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or later is recommended. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/.
- **npm**: This comes bundled with Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL**: The application requires a PostgreSQL database. You can download it from https://www.postgresql.org/download/.
- **Git**: Required for some dependency installations.

---

### Step 1: Unzip the Project
Unzip the `ShiftPlanner.zip` file into your desired directory. This will create a `ShiftPlanner` folder.

---

### Step 2: Set up the Database
1.  **Start PostgreSQL**: Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running.
2.  **Create a Database**: Create a new database for the application. You can name it `shiftplannerdb` or anything you prefer.
3.  **Configure the Connection**:
    -   Navigate into the `backend/` directory.
    -   Inside `backend/`, create a new file named `.env`.
    -   Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing the placeholders with your actual database credentials:
        ```
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/shiftplannerdb"
        ```
        *   Replace `YOUR_USER` with your PostgreSQL username.
        *   Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your PostgreSQL password.
        *   If your database is not on your local machine or uses a different port, update `localhost:5432`.
        *   Replace `shiftplannerdb` with the name of the database you created.
4.  **Run Database Migrations**:
    -   While still in the `backend/` directory, run this command in your terminal. It will set up all the necessary tables in your database.
        ```
        npx prisma migrate dev
        ```

---

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
You need to install the required packages for both the backend and the frontend.

1.  **Backend Dependencies**:
    -   In your terminal, navigate to the `backend/` directory.
    -   Run the command:
        ```
        npm install
        ```
2.  **Frontend Dependencies**:
    -   In your terminal, navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
    -   Run the command:
        ```
        npm install
        ```

---

### Step 4: Run the Application
1.  Navigate to the **root** `ShiftPlanner/` directory in your terminal.
2.  Make the start and stop scripts executable (you only need to do this once):
    ```
    chmod +x start.sh stop.sh restart.sh
    ```
3.  Run the start script:
    ```
    ./start.sh
    ```

This will launch both the backend server and the frontend application. Once it's running, you can open your web browser and go to **http://localhost:3000** to see the app.

---

### To Stop the Application:
-   From the root `ShiftPlanner/` directory, run:
    ```
    ./stop.sh
    ```
