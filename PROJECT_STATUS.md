- Health check endpoint (`/health`) - **TESTED AND WORKING**
- Modular route structure for analysts, schedules, and algorithms
- Full CRUD endpoints for all major entities
- Prisma ORM integrated with a refined schema (moving from `Role` to `isScreener`)
- **Core scheduling algorithm implemented**, supporting weekend rotation patterns and screener assignments
- **Schedule health endpoint (`/health/conflicts`)** to detect gaps in coverage
- Database seeding script (`seedAnalysts.ts`) for test data generation

### Frontend ✅
- React/TypeScript app with a component-based architecture
- Full-featured calendar view (`react-big-calendar`) for schedule visualization
- **Interactive calendar with navigation, view switching, and conflict highlighting**
- Dashboard now includes a **"Schedule Health"** section to display conflicts
- New icons created for UI clarity (`AlertIcon`)
- All major components (Dashboard, ScheduleView, AnalystManagement) are connected to the backend
- Robust API service layer using `axios` with interceptors for logging and error handling

### DevOps ✅
- Git repository initialized with proper `.gitignore` and `LICENSE`
- Scripts for starting, stopping, and restarting the application (`start.sh`, `stop.sh`, `restart.sh`)
- Pre-commit hook for project status updates
- Database setup script and migrations are current
- **V0.4 branch created and pushed to origin for next development cycle**

## Recent Key Changes (v0.3)
- **V0.3 Branch Merged:** Successfully merged V0.3 development into master

- **Branch Management:** Established clean branch workflow for feature development

## Previous Key Changes (v0.2)
- **Implemented Core Scheduling Algorithm:** The backend can now generate a full 5-day work schedule based on rotating weekend patterns (Sun-Thu, Mon-Fri, Tue-Sat) and assign screeners
- **Redesigned Schedule View:** Replaced the basic list with an interactive calendar, improving usability
- **Fixed Calendar Interactivity:** Resolved bugs preventing navigation and view changes, making the calendar fully controllable
- **Introduced Schedule Health Monitoring:** Created a backend endpoint and frontend UI to detect and display scheduling conflicts, such as days with missing analyst coverage
- **Refined Database Schema:** Migrated the schema to treat "Screener" as a temporary assignment (`isScreener` on `Schedule`) rather than a permanent `Role`, which better reflects the operational reality
- **Improved Developer Workflow:** Added shell scripts to simplify starting and stopping the application servers
