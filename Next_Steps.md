## Next Steps ###
Now I think is the perfect time to start thinking about the core functionalities. Following hard-core functionalities that this app actually will serve the user on a day-to-day basis.

What and how are algorithms defined??
How does the app generate schedules? What are different constraints?
How do we manage updating analysts?
How do we manage screener role assignments?
How do we manage conflict resolution?
How do we manage equitable distribution of shifts? What are the constraints to keep in mind?
How does custom attributes get decided?
How do calendars other than shifts e.g. events related calendar get displayed? How do users toggle between these?

Answer to each of these questions is a separate feature in itself that needs to be implemented on a phase by phase basis. We need to first examine how to approach this based on different views and functionalities. We need to brainstorm, search the web and try to come up with a impeccable solution. So that the app provides excellent user experience at the same time robust functionality.
